# MicroSTAMP User Interface

The MicroSTAMP User Interface (UI) is an optional component of MicroSTAMP, designed for users to easily interact with the MicroSTAMP microservices. It provides direct access to various APIs, facilitating the management of STPA analyses.

With the MicroSTAMP UI, users can view and manage all their analyses. Each analysis can be accessed individually, allowing for detailed customization, including the option to define a cover image and update specific details. Users can navigate through the different STPA steps associated with each analysis, managing the relevant entities for each step.

In summary, the MicroSTAMP User Interface is an integral yet optional part of the MicroSTAMP system, providing users with a convenient way to engage with the microservices while conducting their STPA analyses.

If you want to visually test the MicroSTAMP APIs, you can access the UI to explore pre-created test analyses and understand how the tool manages STPA entities. This interface is designed to facilitate the work of analysts, allowing you to create and manage your analyses.
