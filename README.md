# MicroSTAMP - Microservices for STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis)

## Description

This repository contains the source code for MicroSTAMP,  a web application based on microservices architecture to support STPA.  Out of the 4 steps of STPA, MicroSTAMP supports steps 1, 2, and 3. We estimate to release the microservice implementation for Step 4 by **January, 2025**.

## End Users Guide

### Prerequisites

To build and run the application as an end-user, youâ€™ll need:

- **Docker**

### Installation

The easiest way to run **microstamp** is using Docker.

#### Step 1: Install Docker and Docker Compose

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine:

- **Docker**: Download and install Docker from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).
- **Docker Compose**: It usually comes installed with Docker Desktop. You can check the version by running:


    docker-compose --version

#### Step 2: Open a Terminal

Navigate to the directory where the `docker-compose.yaml` file is located. You can do this using the `cd` command in your terminal:

	cd /path/to/directory

#### Step 3: Run Docker Compose

Execute the following command to start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

	docker-compose up

This command will:

-   Build the Docker images if they are not already built.
-   Start all the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yaml`.

#### Additional Options

**Run in detached mode** (in the background):

	docker-compose up -d

**View logs**:

	docker-compose logs -f

**Stop the containers**:

	docker-compose down

## Developers Guide

#### Prerequisites

To build and run the application as a software developer, you'll need:
- [JDK 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)
- [MySQL 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql) or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (That's our IDE of choice, but you are free to use other IDEs as well).

### Command-line setup

###$ Step 1: Set up MySQL Databases

#### Prerequisite
Ensure that **MySQL** is installed and running on your machine. The default port for MySQL is `3306`. If MySQL is not installed, you can download it from the official MySQL website:

- [Download MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

#### Creating the Databases

Once MySQL is installed and running, follow the steps below to create the necessary databases for the project.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Log in to MySQL using the following command:

   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
You will be prompted to enter your MySQL root password.

3. Create the required databases by running the following SQL commands:

CREATE DATABASE microstamp;
CREATE DATABASE step1;
CREATE DATABASE step2;
CREATE DATABASE step3;

4. Verify that the databases were created successfully:

SHOW DATABASES;
You should see `microstamp`, `step1`, `step2`, and `step3` listed in the output.

That's it! Your MySQL databases are now set up and ready to use.


#### Running MicroSTAMP within IntelliJ Idea Ultimate Edition

We use IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3.5 Ultimate Edition in this example of how to use IntelliJ to run MicroSTAMP. I what follows we provide the steps needed to get MicroSTAMP up an running.

**Step 1 - Run the MicrostampServiceRegistryApplication microservice**

There several ways to run a microservice with IntelliJ. One possible way is shown in Figure 1.

	<figcaption>Figure 1: Running the service registry microservice.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>
 As shown in the console output of Figure 2, the MicrostampServiceRegistryApplication runs on Tomcat, port 8761.
<p></p>

	<figcaption>Figure 2: The service registry runs on port 8761.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

We can access the service registry administration page (Spring Eureka) by the URL `http://localhost:8761/`. At this moment, no microservice instances are registered with the service registry.

## MicroSTAMP microservices 

### 1. MicroSTAMP Service Registry

The MicroSTAMP Service Registry microservice(microstamp-service-registry) is implemented with Sprint Cloud Netflix Eureka Server. Service registry and discovery play an important role when running multiple instances of services and we need a mechanism to call other services without hard coding their host names or port numbers.

With MicroSTAMP Service Registry we need to only configure an ID for each microservice that register itself as client with the MicroSTAMP Service Registry. In that sense, we don't have to bother about the hostname and port of the microservices instances that we want to communicate.

In addition to that, in cloud environments, service instances may come up and go down any time. Hence, we need some automatic service registration and discovery mechanism as the provided in this microservice.

Basically all MicroSTAMP microservices (microstamp-api-gateway, microstamp-stpa-step1, microstamp-stpa-step2, microstamp-stpa-step3, microstamp-stpa-step4) register themselves to  Service Registry, and Service Registry tracks all the MicroSTAMP microservices and its instances. We can use service Registry in order to see what are the microservices are up and what are the microservices down.

### 2. MicroSTAMP API Gateway

The microstamp-api-gateway is a microservice of MicroSTAMP that implements an **API gateway**. An API gateway is a critical pattern in a microservices architecture that acts as a single entry point for all client interactions with the microservices. It provides a unified interface for external clients to interact with various microservices, managing the complexity of communication between them and offering several essential functions, such as:

1.  **Routing**: Directs incoming requests from clients to the appropriate microservice based on the request path or other criteria.
2.  **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensures that only authenticated and authorized requests can access the microservices (by delegating the flow of control to the microstamp-authorization-server microservice.
3.  **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple instances of a microservice to prevent overload and improve performance.
4.  **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Controls the number of requests allowed from clients to prevent abuse or overuse of services.
5.  **Caching**: Stores frequently accessed data temporarily to reduce load on backend services and improve response times.
6.  **Monitoring and Logging**: Tracks requests and responses for performance monitoring, logging, and debugging.
7.  **Request Transformation**: Modifies request or response headers, payloads, or other attributes to meet specific needs.

In the MicroSTAMP, the API gateway is implemented using the **Spring Cloud Gateway**. Spring Cloud Gateway is part of the **Spring Cloud** ecosystem, specifically designed for building a robust and flexible API gateway on top of the **Spring Framework**. The key features of Spring Cloud Gateway are:

1.  **Built on Spring Ecosystem**: It leverages the power of the Spring ecosystem, providing seamless integration with other Spring Cloud components like service discovery (Eureka), security (Spring Security), and configuration management.
2.  **Declarative Routing**: Allows the configuration of routes in a declarative way using Java configuration or YAML/Properties files.
3.  **Filter Mechanisms**: Provides powerful pre-built filters (such as pre-filters and post-filters) for manipulating requests and responses and allows custom filters to be defined.
4.  **Reactive Programming Model**: Built on **Spring WebFlux**, a reactive programming model that is non-blocking and asynchronous, making it suitable for handling a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.
5.  **Integration with OAuth2 and JWT**: Supports modern authentication protocols like OAuth2 and JWT for securing APIs.

Summing up, using an API gateway simplifies the client-side complexity by hiding the details of the underlying microservices, providing a single point of entry, and handling cross-cutting concerns like security, monitoring, and rate limiting. It enables a scalable, efficient, and secure way to manage traffic between clients and services, making it a fundamental component in modern microservices architectures.
